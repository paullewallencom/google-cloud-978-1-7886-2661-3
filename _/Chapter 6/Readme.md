# Cloud Natural Language

In the last chapter, we have seen how to work with Cloud Speech API and how we can integrate the Cloud Speech API with SmartExchange to convert speech to text.

In this chapter, we are going to work with Cloud Natural Language API. We are going to let the users reply to a thread using a text message, which we already have now. And before we save that message to the Database, we will send that text for Sentiment Analysis, Entity Analysis, Syntax Analysis, Entity Sentiment Analysis & Classifying content. 

This will help us understand the mood and type of content. In this chapter, we are only going to display the response from the Cloud Natural Language API and not act on the results.
