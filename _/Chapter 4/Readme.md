# Video Intelligence API

In the last chapter, we have seen how to work with Cloud Vision API. We then have seen how to integrate this API with SmartExchange and get labels from the uploaded images, as well as administer the image before posting it using the Safe Search Annotations.

In this chapter, we are going to work with Video Intelligence API. We are going to let a user record a video from the app and then upload this video to Video Intelligence API and get labels as well as detect any explicit content. 

Topics covered are
* What is Video Intelligence API?
