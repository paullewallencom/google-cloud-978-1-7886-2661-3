Cognition as a Service (CAAS) is the new kid on the block. No longer engineers spend time in building intelligence on top of their applications. Now, intelligence or smartness is borrowed from various services.
Welcome to the book on “Getting started with Google Cloud AI Services”, where we are going to explore the powerful Google Cloud AI services via a project based approach. We are going to build a forum application, similar to Discourse or Stack Overflow where users start a discussion thread and other users comment on them.

* What is Google Cloud Platform?
