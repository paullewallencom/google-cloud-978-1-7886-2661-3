# Setup SmartExchange

In the last chapter, we have seen what is Google Cloud Platform and what services it offers. We dwelled deep into one of its verticals named Google Cloud AI and went through all the services in that vertical.
In this chapter, we are going to get started with our hands on learning on Google Cloud AI services. We are going to setup the basic project and work on top of it from the next chapter onwards.

Topics covered in this chapter are

* Design & Architecture of SmartExchange
* Technology overview
* Project Setup and exploration
* Deploy the base app to Heroku
