# Cloud Translation

In the last chapter, we have seen how to work with Cloud Natural Language API and how we can integrate the Cloud Natural Language API with SmartExchange to detect the emotion in text.

In this chapter, we are going to work with Cloud Translation API. Next to each text reply, we are going to provide a button, using which the message text can be converted to any language of userâ€™s preference. 

Topics covered are
