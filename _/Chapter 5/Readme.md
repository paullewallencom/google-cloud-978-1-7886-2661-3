# Cloud Speech API

In the last chapter, we have seen how to work with Video Intelligence API and how we can integrate the Video Intelligence API with SmartExchange to detect the labels in video as well as detect explicit content.
In this chapter, we are going to work with Cloud Speech API. We are going to let the users reply with an Audio recording from the browser using WebRTC. We are then going to send this audio sample to Cloud Speech API to get the content of it in English.

This way, we can get the text from the audio to perform a search or detect the sentiment of the content later on.

Topics covered are
* What is Video Intelligence API?
